  "We shouldn\u2019t have tried to create new symbols,\u201d he said. We should\u2019ve realized we weren\u2019t supposed to introduce uncertainties into accepted belief, that we weren\u2019t supposed to stir up curiosity about God. We are daily confronted by the terrifying instability of all things human, yet we permit our religions to grow more rigid and controlled, more conforming and oppressive. What is this shadow across the highway of Divine Command? It is a warning that institutions endure, that symbols endure when their meaning is lost, that there is no summa of all attainable knowledge. \"Admission\" of C.E.T. Chairman Toure Bomoko, in \"Appendix II: The Religion of Dune",
  "Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ... aortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be conscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not produce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-permanence within....",

  "What a dolt my father sends me for weaponry,\u201d Paul intoned. \u201cThis doltish Gurney Halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man armed and shielded.\u201d Paul snapped the force button at his waist, felt the crinkled-skin tingling of the defensive field at his forehead and down his back, heard external sounds take on characteristic shield-filtered flatness. \u201cIn shield fighting, one moves fast on defense, slow on attack,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAttack has the sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for the attack sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!\u201d Paul snapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a slow thrust timed to enter a shield\u2019s mindless defenses.",
  "I guess I\u2019m not in the mood for it today,\u201d Paul said. \u201cMood?\u201d Halleck\u2019s voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield\u2019s filtering. \u201cWhat has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises\u2014no matter the mood! Mood\u2019s a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It\u2019s not for fighting.",

  "When your opponent fears you, then\u2019s the moment when you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become terror. The terrified man fights himself. Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake. You are being trained here to detect these mistakes and use them.",

And I thought she meant they didn\u2019t speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn\u2019t it at all. She said she meant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don\u2019t hear just with your ears.

  "Paul sat down where Hawat had been, straightened the papers. One more day here, he thought. He looked around the room. We\u2019re leaving. The idea of departure was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He recalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of many things\u2014the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides, the suns\u2014the unknown sum called nature, a vague summation without any sense of the now.

  "When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.",
  "How the mind gears itself for its environment, she thought. And she recalled a Bene Gesserit axiom: \u201cThe mind can go either direction under stress\u2014toward positive or toward negative: on or off.
